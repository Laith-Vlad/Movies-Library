## Overview
This is a Node.js web application built with the Express.js framework that interacts with the API of the movie database (TMDb). It allows users to retrieve and display movie data based on different queries, such as search, trending, and overview. The application uses Axios to make HTTP requests to TMDb API and dotenv to store and retrieve environmental variables, such as API key and port number. The app also includes error handling for 404 and 500 errors. Overall, My code implements several endpoints for retrieving and displaying movie data, uses a constructor function to extract the required data, and makes use of async/await to handle API requests asynchronously.
